          10.1. CTG provides the Platform through which you can enter into a
          contract with a third party supplier of a Product (&quot;
          <b>Supplier</b>&quot;).  CTG is not a supplier of any Product, and
          your contract for supply of any Product you Book will be directly
          between you and the applicable Supplier. In respect of each Booking,
          CTG acts as a disclosed agent on behalf of the Supplier, meaning that
          a Product listing represents an invitation to you to make an offer to
          a Supplier and that we are free to accept or reject such offer on
          behalf of that Supplier. These Terms of Use govern your use of the
          Services, which includes your use of the Platform through which you
          may make such an offer to a Supplier. However, the provision of the
          Product you Book will be subject to the terms and conditions displayed
          on the Website in respect of such Product, any information made
          available to you during the Booking process, and the terms and
          conditions of the Supplier with whom you have a legal contract for the
          supply of the Product.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>
          10.2 If you make a Booking, you agree to review and be bound by the
          applicable Supplier's terms and conditions and any other rules or
          policies related to the Product (the &quot;<b>Supplier Terms</b>
          &quot;). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the
          Supplier Terms conflict with these Terms of Use in respect of your
          legal relationship with CTG, these Terms of Use shall prevail. Your
          interactions with Suppliers are at your own risk.  CTG will have no
          liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors,
          representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any Supplier or
          for any personal injuries, death, property damage, or other damages or
          expenses resulting from your interactions with any Supplier.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>
          10.3 CTG is not a travel agency and does not provide or own any
          Experiences. Although CTG provides the Website with information about
          Products and facilitates Bookings, such actions do not in any way
          constitute CTG's sponsorship or approval of such Suppliers, or any
          affiliation between CTG  and any Supplier. CTG does not endorse or
          recommend any Products. You agree that CTG is not responsible for the
          accuracy or completeness of information it obtains from Suppliers
          and/or that is displayed on the Website.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>
          10.4 By making a Booking, you warrant that you are at least 18 years
          of age, that you possess the legal authority to enter into both this
          binding agreement and a binding agreement with the Supplier, to use
          the Services, to purchase the Product, and that all information you
          supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the
          Platform to make only legitimate Bookings for you and/or others for
          whom you are legally authorised to act.

          13.1 When you make a Booking, CTG collects your payment information
          and processes your payment as described in Section 14. In doing so,
          CTG acts as the limited payment collection agent of the Supplier,
          collecting your payment for the applicable Product(s) on behalf of
          such Supplier. Full payment by credit or debit card is required to
          make a Booking unless otherwise specified. The payee will be listed as
          Corfu Tourist Ltd on your statement.

        <span>
          13.2 The value of your Booking may be subject to taxes, duties,
          foreign transactions, currency exchange, or other fees. Your bank or
          payment card company may convert the payment into the local currency
          and may charge fees, resulting in differences between the amount
          displayed through the Platform, and the final amount charged to you.
          CTG recommends that you contact your bank or card company if you have
          any questions concerning any applicable currency conversion or fees.

        <span>
          15.1 Once a Product has been purchased, your Booking cannot be changed
          by you or cancelled with a refund, unless otherwise stated in the
          terms and conditions applicable to such Product.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>
          15.2 The standard cancellation policy allows you to request a change
          to and/or cancel a Booking up until 24 hours before the start time of
          the Booking; or if the Experience does not have an explicit start
          time, the deadline to request a change or to cancel will generally be
          11:59pm, two days before the start date. Timings are calculated in
          accordance with the time zone of the Experience.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>
          15.3 If any Product is designated as 'All Sales Final' or with
          materially similar messaging, it is non-refundable, and it will not be
          possible to change or cancel it after making a Booking. A minority of
          Products have other, different cancellation policies.{" "}
          <b>
            In all circumstances, you must check the cancellation policy
            contained in the applicable Product listing at the time of your
            Booking, which is the policy that will apply to and govern the terms
            of your cancellation and any refunds.

          15.4 Notwithstanding Sections 15.2 and 15.3, (a) requests for
          modifications and amendments to a Booking, including date change
          requests (collectively, a &quot;<b>Change Request</b>&quot;) should be
          made directly to the provider of the service you booked, whose contact
          details are available within the booking information. Please note that
          a Supplier may charge a fee to accommodate a Change Request; in such
          circumstances, you will be required to pay such a fee in order that
          the supplier may successfully process your Change Request.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>
          15.5 All Change Requests shall be processed by and subject to the
          availability and agreement of the applicable Supplier. CTG does not
          guarantee the success of any Change Request. To the extent the
          Supplier is unwilling or unable to accept such Change Request, then
          your right to a refund (if any) shall be governed by the cancellation
          terms of your Booking.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>
          15.6 If you make a Booking using a promotion code, or if you accept a
          discount or special-offer price during the check-out process, you may
          invalidate your discount or special-offer price by making a Change
          Request after Booking.

          15.7 No refunds are available once an Experience has commenced, or in

          services that have started to be utilised.

          16.1 Occasionally a Supplier may make a change to a Product after your
          purchase, including but not limited to the date, price, inclusions,
          coverage, age requirements, and/or any other Product features and/or
          requirements. As a result, CTG (acting on the Supplier’s behalf),
          reserves the right to cancel, change or substitute any Product that
          you have purchased, at any time, for any reason. If the change
          proposed by the Supplier is material (for example, a change in dates
          and/or a significant change to the itinerary), and you are
          dissatisfied with the alternative that is offered, you will be
          entitled to a full refund of the original purchase price.

          desirable for the protection of our interests, the Supplier's
          interests and/or your interests, to withdraw our Services resulting in
          an override of the Product's cancellation policy and the effective
          cancellation of a Booking. We may also determine, in our sole
          discretion, to arrange a refund to you in part or all of the amounts
          charged to you. You agree that we and the applicable Supplier shall

          you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel
          documents, including passports and visas, are in order.

        <span>
          17.2 For applicable passport and visa requirements, you should consult
          the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Such requirements
          may change at any time, and it is your responsibility to check for
          up-to-date information before making a Booking and before your
          departure. CTG accepts no liability in connection with any person who
          is refused entry onto a flight or into any country, including
          countries such person may just be passing through en route to their
          destination.

          notice, CTG  recommends that you verify health and visa requirements
          with the appropriate consulate prior to departure. It is also your
          responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations
          on inoculations before you travel internationally and to ensure that
          you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance

          insurance policy prior to departure to protect your Product purchase.

          travel insurance policy may reimburse the cost of cancellation fees
          and related expenses. Please review your travel insurance policy
          carefully for related terms and conditions.

          Supplier.

          21.4 In some cases, a Supplier may also require that you present the
          payment card used to purchase your Product at the time of redemption.
          This typically applies to attraction and show tickets. You should be
          advised at check-out whether or not this will be required. If you have
          questions about such a requirement, contact the Supplier directly.
